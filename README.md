Hi! In this repository I showcase my knowledge of a web application development.

In the repository and its relatives I'm using:
* PHP (because it's popular) as a backend
* typescript (because i ❤️ it) as a frontend
* docker-compose for an easier self-hosted deployment
* redis, nginx, etc as the docker services
